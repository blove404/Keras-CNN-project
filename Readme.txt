	This project consists of a CNN that is desinged to process data in this case images and then classify the images of mammals and birds. 
I used deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and numpy. This was necessary in order to build the blocks and tulitites to construct 
and train a well developed and deployed CNN model. We worked with a little over 50,000 images for our dataset, so that it would train with a 
good amount of traning data. I also provided a feature so that it actually with test an image using the weights of the model being trained.
